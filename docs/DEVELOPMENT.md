# Development guide

This guide is the practical route for extending Family Wishlist while preserving its warm product
experience and strong privacy model. [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
provide the useful context behind each recipe.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 (22.22 or newer is supported; `.nvmrc` selects 24)
- npm 11 or newer
- a checkout of the repository

Ordinary local development and tests run without Cloudflare credentials. Vite and Vitest keep remote
bindings isolated, giving contributors fast deterministic product-import coverage while preserving a
deployment's Browser Run and Workers AI allowances.

The shared `wrangler.jsonc` contains no household identifiers. An optional ignored
`.wishlist-installation.json` or `WISHLIST_INSTALLATION` build variable supplies them for deployment;
see [Installation settings](INSTALLATION_CONFIG.md). Do not edit shared source to select a household.

## First local run

```sh
npm install
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run dev
```

Open the localhost URL printed by Vite. A fixed `local-development@family.invalid` identity is enabled
only in development and only for loopback hostnames. Its member and wishlist are provisioned in the
local D1 database on first request.

Wrangler keeps local Cloudflare state under `.wrangler/`, which is ignored. Local data is not copied
to production. If a migration is added, rerun `npm run db:migrate:local` before exercising the change.

Work on `main`. The `stable` branch is maintained by the release workflow; do not make changes directly on it. See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for the release procedure.

Run `npm run quality` and `npm run audit` before every commit or push. CI repeats those checks.
The quality gate includes `scripts:check`, keeping native Node compatibility verified for every setup
tool. Setup runners invoke Wrangler with `process.execPath` and its JavaScript entry,
not `npx.cmd`: Windows cannot execute that command shim directly through `spawnSync`. Do not add
`shell: true` to work around it; arguments and private stdin must remain outside a shell. The Access
application helper locates the installed `cf` package through npm and launches its Node entry too.
`.gitattributes` keeps text files at LF on Windows, including when Git enables `core.autocrlf`, so
the formatting gate does not fail immediately after a fresh clone.

## How a request moves through the code

1. `workers/app.ts` receives the request, applies the production security boundary and validates the
   Cloudflare Access identity.
2. `app/lib/context.ts` makes the verified identity and D1 binding available to React Router.
3. `app/routes/home.tsx` provisions the member, loads the selected family wishlist and dispatches
   form intents.
4. `app/lib/product-metadata.ts` performs bounded public-page lookups for the optional link helper.
5. `app/lib/db/members.ts` and `app/lib/db/wishlists.ts` own database rules and validation.
   `app/routes/family.tsx`, `app/lib/db/family-members.ts` and
   `app/lib/cloudflare/access-membership.ts` own the organiser-only admission flow.
6. React Router renders the response through `app/root.tsx`; the current UI and forms are in
   `app/routes/home.tsx` with reusable brand/footer pieces in `app/components/`.

Read-only viewing links are the narrow exception to the authenticated request flow. `workers/app.ts`
admits only exact GET/HEAD shared-list paths without an identity. `app/lib/db/shared-wishlists.ts`
hashes capability tokens and owns the claim-free public queries; shared routes must never call the
authenticated family-list query or accept mutations.

The route is intentionally server-first. Prefer a loader/action and an ordinary form over adding a
client state/API layer. Add browser JavaScript only when it materially improves an interaction and
the no-JavaScript path remains sound.

## Change recipes

### Product or form behaviour

- Start in `app/routes/home.tsx` to find the relevant loader/action intent.
- Put reusable validation and database invariants in `app/lib/`, not only in the component.
- Preserve the selected `?list=` query parameter after actions.
- Test malformed and missing `FormData`, ownership constraints, stale IDs and the successful path.
- Check the family-facing wording against [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

The home route contains the core family workspace. New substantial interactions are best expressed as
a cohesive component or server helper, keeping that central route welcoming and easy to navigate.
Its item fields, rows, claims, add panel and sheet coordination live in
`app/components/wishlist/`; bounded lookup drafts live in `app/lib/wishlist-form-draft.ts`.
The extraction entry point remains `app/lib/product-metadata.ts`, with implementation modules under
`app/lib/product-metadata/`. Keep dependencies one-way and retain the public entry point for callers.

Product metadata lookup is progressive enhancement. Keep the ordinary `fetch-product` form intent
working without JavaScript. The `/add?url=` loader must render without fetching the external page;
`data-product-auto-fetch` starts a lookup after hydration, and failed form submissions must not
automatically start another lookup. Keep `public/product-import.js` limited to the same-origin convenience
layer, and initialise each new form once when client navigation mounts it as well as on first load.
Any outbound page fetch must preserve the timeout, response-byte cap, manual redirect checks,
public-target checks, member-scoped D1 lookup budget and credential-free request in
`app/lib/product-metadata.ts`. AI extraction must
remain optional, receive only reduced public-page text, accept only source-supported values and never
save a wish. Add general evidence rules before retailer-specific ones; keep retailer exceptions in a
hostname-matched adapter, and add a compact regression fixture for every new metadata shape. Challenge
pages must be rejected before AI is called. Product image rules must return a validated HTTPS draft.
When the AI enrichment pass is already needed, it may select only an integer index from a bounded list of
validated page-image candidates; never accept a model-provided URL or automatically load
private/local targets. Inject `ProductAiExtractor` in tests rather than connecting the test pool to
Workers AI. Inject `ProductPageRenderer` for Browser Run fallback tests; the production renderer must
remain a single bounded Quick Action attempted only after the ordinary fetch paths fail. It must not
receive cookies, credentials, family headers or private targets, and rendered redirects and HTML must
pass the same validation and byte limits before extraction. `ProductImageField` keeps its picture
address in the submitted form while presenting a
thumbnail-first interface; every preview and saved picture must use the same-origin `/product-image`
proxy. Preserve its redirect validation, public-network enforcement, raster allowlist and 4 MiB cap.
`public/product-import.js` owns the optional live preview, change and remove conveniences across both
ordinary and multi-list forms.

The image proxy also consumes the member's atomic minute and UTC-day D1 budget before fetching. Keep
the limits in `app/lib/db/product-images.ts`, cover both reset boundaries and do not replace the
database guard with an in-memory counter.

The **Add from anywhere** page is presented by `app/routes/bookmarklet.tsx` at the existing
`/bookmarklet` URL. `app/lib/bookmarklet.ts` derives both the add-page address used by Apple Shortcuts
and the desktop bookmarklet from the current deployment origin. `public/pwa-install.js` registers the
cache-free service worker and progressively exposes Android installation; `public/bookmarklet.js`
handles the browser button, copy and clipboard conveniences. The manifest’s GET-only share target
lands on `app/routes/share-target.ts`, which accepts only a validated public product link before
redirecting to `app/routes/add.tsx`. All entry points must carry only the product URL and never
identity or family data. Do not add a service-worker fetch handler or cache authenticated HTML.
Clipboard and shared input must remain limited to credential-free HTTP(S) links. Preserve the visual
drag guidance, no-JavaScript add-form fallback, editable metadata fallbacks and the guarded,
all-or-nothing multi-list service mutation.

`public/Wishlist.shortcut` is the Apple-validated, hostname-neutral Share Sheet
shortcut. Its import question stores the deployment-specific add-page prefix locally on the member's
device. Keep the manual current-UI recipe as a recovery route and follow
`docs/APPLE_SHORTCUT.md` whenever the signed file changes.

### Database query or mutation

- Read `migrations/0001_initial.sql` and the existing service tests first.
- Use D1 prepared statements and `.bind()` for every value.
- Validate UUIDs and bounded strings at the service boundary.
- Check that filters and ordering use an existing index; add an index in a new migration if needed.
- Keep claim data out of owner-visible result shapes at query/service level.
- Add Workers-runtime tests for invalid data, missing rows, competing operations and privacy branches.

### Schema change

1. Add a new numbered SQL file under `migrations/`; never rewrite a migration already applied to a
   shared database.
2. Update query/service types and test fixtures.
3. Apply it locally with `npm run db:migrate:local`.
4. If the migration adds an index, finish it with `PRAGMA optimize;` so SQLite refreshes planner
   statistics after applying it.
5. Run the complete quality gate.
6. Update architecture, deployment or product docs if the persistent model changed.

Test upgrades with populated data from the previous schema as well as a fresh database. Preserve
existing member/list IDs, wishes, claims, invitation repair states and supported viewing links.
Pending migrations must remain compatible with the running Worker, and retrying the production
command must apply only outstanding migrations before updating the Worker.

`npm run db:migrate:remote` mutates production data. Run it only when explicitly authorised and only
after reading the account-specific private handoff and verifying the active Wrangler profile.

### Worker bindings or Cloudflare configuration

- Edit `wrangler.jsonc`, then run `npm run cf-typegen`.
- Use the generated binding types; do not hand-maintain an `Env` interface.
- Retrieve current Cloudflare documentation before trusting remembered Wrangler flags or config fields.
- Do not use another Wrangler profile merely because it is already logged in.
- Do not manually deploy the reference application unless the maintainer requests it; pushes to
  `main` deploy through Cloudflare Builds.

### Authentication or Access

- Treat `workers/app.ts` and `app/lib/auth/access.ts` as one security boundary.
- Verify signature, issuer, audience, expiry, subject and email before resolving a signed-in member.
  Invitation activation creates the member and wishlist atomically after Access succeeds; do not
  record a first sign-in until that person authenticates. Test pre-login wishes and later claim privacy.
- Fail closed when production configuration or the assertion is missing.
- Keep the development identity restricted to a development build and a loopback hostname.
- Never log assertions, tokens or full authentication payloads.
- Keep family admission fail-closed: write a pending invitation before calling Cloudflare, create only
  an exact-email Allow policy, activate it only after Cloudflare succeeds, and never provision a later
  member from a pending or cleanup-required row.
- Never infer the organiser from request order. Production bootstrap requires
  `INITIAL_ORGANISER_EMAIL`; local development may use its fixed loopback-only identity.
- Disable a removed member in D1 before deleting their Access policy, revoke application sessions,
  and preserve their wishlist and history. Keep interrupted invitations and removals repairable.
- Filter disabled owners from family/public reads and shared-image queries, and reject stale wish,
  claim and sharing mutations. Keep the retained data hidden until re-invitation succeeds.
- Treat `ACCESS_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN` as a secret. Keep the account and application identifiers in
  deployment configuration, not family-facing output.
- Keep the Access application at the setup-enforced 30-day duration. Run
  `npm run access:configure-session` with the three Access management environment values after
  creating the application or when repairing configuration drift. The command must preserve and
  verify the application audience, destinations, policies, login methods and cookie settings.
- Keep `access:configure-sharing` and the create-link action on the same
  `ensurePublicSharingAccess()` implementation. It must list applications with verified complete
  pagination, create only `/shared/*`, `/shared-assets/*` and `/favicon.svg`, attach only an Everyone
  Bypass policy, re-read concurrent results, and fail closed on drift before writing a sharing token.
- Preserve the bounded response reader, timeout and compensating policy deletion around Access API
  calls. Inject `fetch` in tests; never call the live API from the test suite.
- Cloudflare Access policy/DNS changes are external mutations and require explicit maintainer authority.
- Keep the unauthenticated Worker exception limited to exact read-only shared-list and shared-image
  paths. A route under the same prefix must not inherit public access accidentally.
- Never store, log or put a raw sharing token in a query string. Public D1 reads must not join claims,
  and shared images must prove both the token and item-to-list relationship before fetching.
- Keep sharing creation and management together on `/family` for every enabled member, while
  admission data and actions remain organiser-only. Count legacy and selection links together in
  guarded inserts to enforce five active household links. Preserve existing tokens and show their
  currently visible lists in the same inventory. Test mixed concurrent creation, legacy revocation,
  invalid selections and disabled actors/owners.
- Keep generated CSS under `/shared-assets/*`; do not move JavaScript bundles into that public Access
  bypass. Shared-image HEAD requests must remain upstream-free, and GET budgets must retain both the
  capability-scoped requester ceiling and the higher list-wide emergency ceiling.
- Preserve the `X-Robots-Tag` header on every response. Do not make `/robots.txt` public merely for
  link-shared lists; keeping the Access bypass as narrow as possible is the stronger boundary.

### Visual or copy change

- Follow [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md); preserve the tactile parcel/paper language and avoid SaaS patterns,
  pills and generic product-spec copy.
- Use British English and direct family language.
- Keep semantic HTML, visible labels, keyboard focus and the JavaScript-free form path.
- Use `InPlaceActionForm` for small mutations that should not navigate. Give every instance a stable,
  resource-specific `actionKey`, show its local pending state, return structured action data so
  React Router revalidates loaders, and render its local error. Keep larger form journeys as ordinary
  navigation forms unless their validation and focus behaviour are designed explicitly.
- The home-page add form is the deliberate middle case: its keyed fetcher keeps the frequent add on
  the working page, while a browser-added form marker lets an unenhanced document post retain its
  redirect. Clear the draft only after structured success data and keep the product-image helper in
  sync by emitting the same input events as a person clearing the link and picture fields.
- Wish editors use the same browser-marker pattern. `ActionDialog` progressively enhances native
  disclosures into modal dialogs, retaining server forms without JavaScript. Keep each fetcher keyed
  by item ID,
  close the editor after a successful revalidation, and restore focus to its trigger with visible
  success feedback so a priority change can safely move the keyed row without losing the keyboard
  position. Failed saves keep the editor open and preserve the draft.
  Check Escape, Cancel, dirty-draft confirmation, focus containment/restoration, scroll stability,
  removal errors and mobile keyboard space. While every dialog control is disabled for a pending
  request, retain focus on the dialog heading and keep both Tab directions inside it.
  Compare actual form values for dirty drafts, including
  picture changes made by the progressive image helper; ignore only the enhancement marker.
- Keep authenticated hydration and every generated script on the per-response CSP nonce. Public
  sharing pages must continue to omit `<Scripts>` and authenticated JavaScript bundles. Preserve the
  `meta[property="csp-nonce"]`, `ServerRouter`, render-stream and CSP wiring together: Vite uses that
  meta nonce for styles it injects in development.
- Exercise the affected flow at desktop and narrow mobile widths. Check empty, populated, validation
  and error states where relevant.
- Optimise committed raster assets and provide meaningful alternative text only when the image conveys
  content; decorative imagery should remain hidden from assistive technology.

`vitest.config.ts` runs tests through the Cloudflare pool. `test/apply-migrations.ts` applies every SQL
migration to the isolated test database, so migration and application code are tested together.

The product-page fetcher deliberately uses a small, coherent desktop-browser navigation header set.
Keep that profile central in `app/lib/product-metadata.ts` so initial requests, redirects and retailer
retries cannot drift apart. Never derive it from the incoming family request or add cookies,
authorisation, a referrer, client IP headers or an explicit compression header.

The current test suite provides extensive Workers-runtime coverage, complemented by deliberate manual
UI verification on desktop and mobile for complete interaction and visual confidence.

## Keep generated and private files in their right place

Keep local/build state such as `.wrangler/`, `build/`, `.react-router/`, `.dev.vars`, database exports
and credentials outside commits. Wrangler owns `worker-configuration.d.ts`; regenerate it with
`npm run cf-typegen` whenever bindings change.

The reference maintainer checkout may have `.private/WRANGLER_PROFILE.md`. It exists to prevent use of
the wrong Cloudflare account, is ignored by Git, and must stay private.

## Finish with confidence

- Read the complete diff, including generated or documentation changes.
- Confirm the product and claim-privacy invariants still hold.
- Run `npm run quality` and `npm run audit`.
- For UI work, test the real form flow on desktop and mobile.
- Explain changed behaviour, verification performed and any remaining risk.
