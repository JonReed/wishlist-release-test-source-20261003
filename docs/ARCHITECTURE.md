# Architecture

## Goals

The architecture gives each family a secure, private and straightforward deployment that fits
comfortably within Cloudflare's free allowances. Workers, D1 and Access provide the complete runtime,
data and identity foundation in one coherent platform.

The product rules that shape this architecture are recorded in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md).

```

Cloudflare Access is the outer admission boundary. The Worker independently validates the Access JWT
signature, issuer, application audience, expiry and required identity claims before trusting the
email, giving every production request two complementary identity checks.

Revocable viewing links use a deliberately configured, path-specific Access Bypass. The Worker
independently recognises only read-only `/shared/<secret>` list and image paths;
all neighbouring paths and every mutation still require a valid Access identity. More-specific Access
paths also expose only the compiled stylesheet under `/shared-assets/*` and the favicon needed to
render that public page. Authenticated JavaScript bundles, the web manifest and install icons remain
behind Access.

Before creating a viewing token, the authenticated action calls
`ensurePublicSharingAccess()` with the request hostname. It lists every Access application, accepts
only the deterministic application containing exactly those three public destinations and one
Everyone Bypass policy, or creates that exact application. Configuration drift fails closed before
D1 changes. The setup command calls the same function, so installation preflight and runtime
enforcement cannot disagree.

## Request lifecycle

1. Access rejects identities outside the deployment's exact email allow-list and handles the OTP UI.
2. `workers/app.ts` verifies the Access assertion and builds an immutable request context containing
   the verified identity and D1 binding.
3. A route calls `ensureMemberForEmail()`. It resolves the existing member/list by verified email and
   records `first_signed_in_at` once, preserving wishes added before login. Only the email in
   `INITIAL_ORGANISER_EMAIL` can bootstrap the first admin. Subsequent member/list pairs are created
   atomically when their exact-email invitation is activated after Access succeeds; unique constraints
   also preserve the legacy first-request path and concurrent-login safety.
4. The loader requests all family wishlists for the viewer. Their own list sorts first; `?list=` chooses
   the active list rendered in the document.
5. Forms post an explicit intent to an action. Before authentication or routing, the Worker requires
   a non-opaque `Origin` that exactly matches the request origin and reads at most 32 KiB of supported
   form data. React Router repeats its own origin check before the action validates the request shape
   and invokes a service mutation. Small actions can return data for automatic loader revalidation;
   larger form journeys redirect. Without JavaScript, both paths remain ordinary document form
   submissions. The add form can instead request an editable draft from a product link without
   creating an item.
6. `/share-target` extracts a validated web link from Android share parameters and redirects to
   `/add?url=`. That add route is also the landing route for the iPhone/iPad Share Sheet Shortcut,
   copied links and the desktop bookmarklet. It immediately renders the shared URL and all family list
   choices. After hydration, the product helper requests details through `/product-details`, filling
   empty fields. During lookup, product fields and saving are disabled; notes, priority and wishlist
   choices remain editable. **Enter details myself** cancels the lookup and ignores late results.
   Completion or failure unlocks the product fields. Without JavaScript, **Fill from
   link** performs the lookup through the ordinary form action. Saving inserts one independent item
   per selected list with a guarded D1 statement.
7. The Worker adds private caching, CSP and other defensive response headers to every response.
8. A read-only shared-list request skips identity validation only when its method and path exactly
   match the public route boundary. It hashes the URL secret and runs a separate D1 query that does
   not reference `claims`. Shared pictures require the same secret plus an item belonging to that
   selected list, pass through the bounded raster proxy and consume both a capability-holder budget and a
   higher list-wide emergency budget. A HEAD request verifies membership but does not fetch or count
   the upstream picture.

The organiser-only admission intents in `/family` are the flows that change the Access admission boundary. The action
validates the organiser role and proposed name/email and writes a non-admitting `pending` invitation
before creating a single exact-email application policy through Cloudflare's API. It marks the row
`active` only after Cloudflare succeeds. If activation fails, it attempts to delete the policy; a
failed rollback is retained as `cleanup_required` with the policy ID. Neither `pending` nor
`cleanup_required` can provision a member, so Access and D1 failures remain fail-closed. The API token
is a Worker secret and is never returned to loaders, HTML or logs.

The **Manage** page exposes interrupted `pending` and `cleanup_required` invitations to the organiser.
Repair first obtains a pagination-verified complete list of the application's Access policies and
reuses only one exact policy-name and exact-email match; otherwise it creates a fresh exact-email
policy. Duplicate or incomplete results fail closed.
Removing an ordinary member first sets `members.disabled_at`, so a still-valid Access session cannot
reach application data, then deletes the exact-email policy and revokes every session for this Access
application. The final D1 state retains the member, wishlist and history while removing admission.
Family-list reads filter disabled owners and require an enabled viewer. Wish and claim mutations
also reject disabled owners, including stale form submissions, preserving their retained data.
An interrupted removal remains visible and can be finished safely; deleting an already absent policy
is idempotent.

Re-inviting a removed email replaces only a fully `revoked` invitation with a fresh `pending`
invitation ID. Active members and unfinished admission or removal states still block duplicate adds;
the conditional write permits only one concurrent re-invitation. The retained member stays disabled
through Access policy creation. Activation clears `disabled_at` and updates the supplied display
name in the same D1 batch, preserving the member ID, wishlist ID, first-sign-in timestamp, wishes and
claims. Interrupted re-invitations remain visible for repair even when their disabled member has
already signed in before. Fresh invitation IDs prevent an old activation from restoring access.

Copying sign-in details is an optional browser convenience after admission succeeds. It copies the
ordinary homepage URL and the admitted email, with no acceptance token or additional activation.
The helper delegates clicks so rows inserted by fetcher revalidation or client-side navigation work
immediately; unavailable clipboard access exposes the address and email for manual copying.

The organiser must be authenticated before inviting anyone. Invitation activation creates the
member/list in the same D1 batch, after the exact-email Access policy succeeds. An invited owner need
not sign in before the family can add wishes. There is no public member-creation endpoint.
Migration 0012 backfills only completed active invitations, preserves existing member/list IDs and
marks pre-existing members as already signed in using their original creation timestamp.

## Framework decision

The project uses React Router v8 in full-stack framework mode with Cloudflare's Vite plugin.

Authenticated pages hydrate React Router's client runtime through nonce-bearing scripts. The shared
`InPlaceActionForm` component uses fetchers for small mutations that should update in place, while
still rendering a native form for browsers without JavaScript. Public sharing pages deliberately
omit the client runtime and all authenticated JavaScript bundles. The per-response nonce is also
published through Vite's `csp-nonce` meta contract so development-injected styles remain covered by
the same strict CSP; dependency-free form helpers load only after React has hydrated the document.

Why:

- loaders and actions keep reads and mutations on the server, which is valuable for claim privacy;
- the Cloudflare Vite plugin runs local server code in the Workers runtime with local bindings;
- React Router and Cloudflare support this route as production-ready;
- it avoids the compatibility layer and larger surface area of Next.js;
- it avoids the duplicated client API/state layer of a Hono plus React SPA architecture; and
- it has a broad React ecosystem while remaining comparatively small.

SvelteKit was evaluated and is a sound option, but offered no material advantage here.

Keep security and database rules below the component layer. A visual condition is allowed to explain a

Tables are SQLite `STRICT` tables with foreign keys, length/state checks and indexes for wishlist
ordering and member claims. Externally visible IDs are UUIDs. A new schema change must be a new numbered
migration; applied migrations are immutable history.

Wishlist reads order items by a priority rank (`high`, `normal`, `low`) and then by descending
creation time. The item expression index mirrors that exact rank expression and includes
`wishlist_id`, `created_at DESC` and `id DESC`, so D1 can search each list's items in the required
order. The family-wide result may still perform a small outer sort to keep the viewer's list first
and the remaining family names alphabetical.

## Claim privacy by construction

The most important boundary is implemented twice in the wishlist service:

1. `LIST_FAMILY_WISHLISTS` joins `claims` only when the wishlist owner is not the current viewer. D1
   therefore does not return the owner's claim row to application rendering code.
2. `WishlistItem` is a discriminated union. Owner items are
   `{ claimVisibility: 'hidden' }` and have no `claim` property; other items explicitly carry a visible
   claim value or `null`.

This is intentionally stronger than selecting all claims and hiding them in JSX. Future JSON routes,
logs, caching or UI refactors must preserve the same omission. Tests should fail if an owner's result
shape gains claim data.

Claims also use `item_id` as their primary key. The database, rather than a check-then-write sequence,
ensures two family members cannot both hold the same item. Release and purchase mutations verify the
current claimant so one member cannot change another member's claim.

## Read-only sharing boundary

A sharing URL carries 16 random bytes encoded as a 22-character URL-safe secret. D1 stores only its
SHA-256 hash, so a database read cannot recover a working link. Each row has a private family-facing
name and a separate internal UUID. Atomic conditional inserts count both sharing tables to enforce
at most five active links across the household. Existing rows above that limit remain usable, but
creation stays blocked until fewer than five remain. Unknown and removed links return the same
not-found result.

New selections use the additive `family_share_links` and `family_share_link_wishlists` tables, so
existing single-list tokens and the running Worker's schema remain compatible during deployment.
A guarded insert validates every selected UUID, the enabled actor and the combined five-link limit.
A transactional D1 batch inserts the link and all selected wishlists together. Missing or disabled
lists cannot leave a partial selection; duplicate IDs are deduplicated. The selection is fixed at
creation while each wishlist's contents stay current.

The authenticated `/family` route is the single sharing surface for every enabled member. Its
inventory combines both tables, showing only currently enabled owners in each visible-list summary.
A universal revocation service deletes the selected UUID from either table in a guarded D1 batch;
selection rows cascade for new links. The public page and its images stop working immediately.
The loader omits admission and invitation data for ordinary members, and all admission actions retain
the organiser check before any database or Access mutation.

The public query selects the list owner and ordinary item fields directly from `wishlists`, `members`
and `items`. A token-hash lookup unions the selected IDs from either kind of link before reading
ordinary wish details; it returns one claim-free result per selected wishlist, including empty lists.
It neither joins nor selects `claims`. Its TypeScript result has no claim field. Shared
image routes look up the stored image only when both the hashed secret and item membership match,
then reuse the public-network, redirect, type and size checks of the signed-in image proxy. A D1-backed
20-per-minute and 100-per-day capability-holder budget prevents one recipient from consuming the
whole allowance. A higher 60-per-minute and 500-per-day list-wide ceiling remains as an emergency
cost bound. The requester key is a SHA-256 derivation salted by the bearer capability; raw network
addresses and reusable cross-link identifiers are never stored.

Public list and image queries require the wishlist owner to have `disabled_at IS NULL`. A removed
owner's single-list link returns the same 404 as an unknown link; a group link omits that owner's
list and returns 404 if no enabled lists remain. Image GET and HEAD requests return 404 before
fetching or consuming a budget. Sharing choices and guarded creation reject disabled owners too,
including a mixed selection that would otherwise create a partial link. Existing sharing tokens and
selections remain stored for management and become usable again if their owner is re-added.

Public responses remain `private, no-store`, use `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, carry a site-wide
`X-Robots-Tag` no-indexing directive and load no third-party scripts or fonts. Application logs redact
capability-bearing paths. Cloudflare's edge can necessarily see the requested URL, so families should
treat each link like an invitation and stop sharing it if it travels beyond the intended people.

## Member photos

Signed-in headers, private wishlist headings and Profile use `/avatar/<member UUID>`. The resource
route resolves an admitted viewer before reading an enabled target member's email and display name
from D1. Removed members' avatar URLs return 404 without an upstream fetch. It hashes the trimmed,
lower-case email with SHA-256 on the server and requests a 160px,
G-rated Gravatar with `d=404`, following [Gravatar's avatar documentation](https://docs.gravatar.com/sdk/images/).
Avatar URLs include the displayed initials as a cache version, so a saved name refreshes its fallback
immediately; the route always derives the image from D1 and ignores those query values. Raw emails
and their hashes never enter avatar URLs in HTML or loader data. Gravatar receives the
email hash from the Worker; it receives no browser cookies, Access assertions, family request headers
or client referrer. Public sharing routes do not use this endpoint or include photos.

Avatar GETs share the existing per-viewer image fetch budget and bounded raster proxy checks.
Missing, unsupported or unavailable images and an exhausted budget return a locally generated
initials SVG. Only letters and numbers enter its text; remote SVGs remain rejected. HEAD requests
verify the member and viewer without an upstream fetch or budget consumption. Successful photos
have a five-minute private browser cache; fallback responses remain uncached so a new photo can
appear on refresh. No schema, credentials or external browser image origins are needed.

## Server-first user interface

The application uses progressively enhanced server-rendered pages and ordinary HTML forms. Core
wishlist and claim operations work without browser JavaScript. This keeps the payload small, gives a
strong accessibility baseline and permits a strict Content Security Policy.

The home-page add form uses a React Router fetcher after hydration so a successful insert can
revalidate the active wishlist, clear the completed draft and report local pending, success or error
state without a document navigation. Its server-rendered form marks itself as enhanced only in the
browser; an unenhanced document submission follows the existing post-redirect-get path. Both paths
call the same route action and wishlist service validation.

Expanded item editors use the same marked-fetcher boundary for a local pending state, validation
feedback and successful loader revalidation. A successful save closes the editor, restores focus to
its summary and shows a confirmation there; an unenhanced edit continues through post-redirect-get.
Removal uses the same marker and returns structured success for loader revalidation. The wishlist
sheet restores focus after the deleted editor unmounts; rows are never optimistically removed.

Sharing-link creation uses the family selection form's fetcher with local pending and error feedback.
The same server action returns the new address for both document and enhanced submissions.
Revalidation updates the combined inventory while the form selects the new address; delegated copy
handling also works for results inserted after hydration. The wishlist shortcut navigates to that
form with its list preselected. Profile has no sharing inventory.
Link revocation uses a link-keyed fetcher and a browser-only submission marker to preserve the native
redirect. The parent sharing list restores focus after revalidation removes a row. Revocation stays
server-confirmed and never optimistically hides a still-active link. Removing the newly created link
also removes its copy result.

The product-link helper is another progressively enhanced interaction: a small nonce-authorised,
self-hosted script starts the lookup after a link is pasted or changed. The ordinary “Fill from link”
form action remains the fallback when JavaScript is unavailable, and creating a wish never depends on
the script. The server remains authoritative. `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` are not acceptable
shortcuts.

The top navigation exposes the **Add from anywhere** setup page. The web app manifest registers an
installed Android PWA as a GET-only share target; `/share-target` validates a dedicated URL or finds
one in Android’s shared text before redirecting to `/add`. The Apple-validated shortcut in
`public/Wishlist.shortcut` uses a one-time import question to store the server-generated
`/add?url=` prefix locally; the matching manual recipe remains a recovery path. The optional clipboard
helper validates a credential-free HTTP(S) link before navigating. React does not server-render the
desktop `javascript:` link; a small nonce-authorised, self-hosted script copies a server-generated,
deployment-specific value from a data attribute into the draggable link. These entry points carry
only the product URL to `/add`; authentication, metadata lookup, validation and saving all remain
inside the protected Worker.

A minimal service worker enables installation but has no fetch handler and creates no caches. The
manifest link uses `crossorigin="use-credentials"` because Cloudflare Access protects that resource
too. Family HTML, identity state and wishlist data therefore remain online-only and continue to
receive `private, no-store`. CSP permits only same-origin workers.

Multi-list adds use one parameter-bound `INSERT … SELECT` statement. A completeness check inside the
statement suppresses every insert when any selected wishlist no longer exists, avoiding partial saves.
The wishlist primary key and existing `(wishlist_id, position, created_at)` item index support the
selection join and per-list position lookup.

## Product-page extraction

Product import is deliberately staged:

1. Fetch at most 512 KiB from a public HTTP(S) target, with manual redirect validation and an
   eight-second timeout.
2. Detect verification and CAPTCHA pages before accepting any details or invoking AI. Retry once,
   using a retailer-specific alternate public product route where an adapter can derive one. Amazon
   UK challenges Cloudflare egress on some desktop product pages, so its retry fetches the equivalent
   lightweight mobile page while the editable draft retains a clean canonical `/dp/` product link.
3. When a blocked response, verification page or empty application shell would otherwise end the
   lookup, ask the Browser Run `content` Quick Action to render that already-validated public URL.
   It receives no family headers, cookies or identity, blocks image/media/font downloads, has a
   ten-second navigation/action timeout and is attempted at most once. Its response and navigation
   URLs are validated and bounded before the same deterministic extraction runs again. Browser Run
   is identifiable automation and may still be challenged; failure quietly preserves manual entry.
4. Run the bounded HTML through one native `HTMLRewriter` evidence pass. Ordered rules prefer a
   retailer's explicit current/base price and primary product image, then JSON-LD, Open Graph,
   schema.org microdata and known visible product fields. Retailer adapters contain narrowly scoped
   rules such as Amazon UK title cleanup, price selection and high-resolution image selection;
   standard metadata remains the default for every other site.
5. If a reliable title or GBP price is still missing and AI is enabled, remove scripts, styles,
   navigation, site headers and footers, forms, cookie controls, adverts, recommendations, reviews,
   social controls and repeated text. Headings, price-adjacent lines and main product content are
   prioritised, deduplicated and capped at 10,000 characters. If deterministic rules found no image,
   collect at most eight public HTTPS image candidates from that same reduced page, rejecting obvious
   logos, icons, tracking pixels and small assets.
6. Ask the configured Workers AI model only for the missing fields and, when candidates exist, the
   index of the most likely primary product image. Page evidence is explicitly treated as untrusted
   data, not instructions. A returned title or price is accepted only when it appears in the reduced
   source text; an image selection is accepted only when its integer index resolves to the original
   validated candidate. The model cannot provide or invent an image URL.
7. Return an editable draft. Browser and AI timeouts, exhausted free allocations, capacity errors
   and invalid output quietly leave the best deterministic result or manual form in place.

JSON-LD product candidates remain separate. Prefer an exact product URL, then the page's explicit
main entity, then page relationships and query-independent URL matches; otherwise retain the first
product for compatibility. Exact variant URLs outrank query-independent matches. Only the selected
product contributes structured titles, offers and pictures, so recommendations cannot fill its gaps.

Failed lookups carry a safe diagnostic summary to both the JSON helper and ordinary form responses:
the requested hostname, attempted fetch/retry/browser stages, numeric HTTP statuses, fixed outcome
descriptions and elapsed time. No page HTML, full URLs, query strings, credentials, response headers
or raw exception messages enter this summary. Browser-service failures and shop failures are distinct.
The form keeps these details collapsed, with an optional clipboard control and selectable text.

Product images remain HTTPS URLs rather than copied binary data. Deterministic metadata remains the
first choice; AI image selection happens only as part of an already-needed enrichment pass and only
from the page's bounded candidate list. Browser markup uses the same-origin `/product-image` route,
not the remote address. That route requires a completed family membership, validates every redirect,
relies on Workers public-network fetch enforcement, accepts only five raster formats, buffers at most
4 MiB and caches the safe response for one day in the member's private browser cache. SVG and
ambiguous response types are rejected. This
prevents family browsers from exposing
their address or cookies to an arbitrary picture host and keeps CSP `img-src` same-origin. No R2
bucket or image-processing service is required.

Before any outbound image request, the route consumes a member-scoped D1 budget of 60 fetches per
minute and 500 per UTC day. One atomic upsert checks both limits, so parallel requests cannot step
past either cap.

No Access assertion, cookie, family data or requesting-user identity is sent to the model. The model
cannot fetch another URL, invoke a tool or persist anything. Only the ordinary add-wish action can
save the checked draft.

## Local and production identity

Production accepts only a verified Access assertion for the configured team issuer and application
audience. It returns a generic authentication failure when the assertion is invalid and a service
configuration failure when required settings are missing.

Development can synthesise one fixed email only when both conditions are true:

- the bundle is running in Vite's development mode; and
- the request hostname is loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`).

This mechanism avoids storing developer credentials and cannot be enabled through a production
environment variable.

## Why Cloudflare

The goal is a private family application without an ongoing server-administration hobby. Each
household owns its installation and Cloudflare account; this is not a shared hosted Family Wishlist
service. Cloudflare is the supported hosting platform, rather than an alternative to ownership.

- **Managed infrastructure:** [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) runs on
  Cloudflare's global network. There is no home machine to keep online, operating system to patch,
  router port to expose or separate reverse proxy to maintain. Global compute does not mean this
  application replicates its D1 database everywhere or guarantees equal latency worldwide.
- **Admission and sign-in:** Access handles exact-email admission and one-time PIN delivery; the
  Worker independently verifies its signed assertions. The application needs no password database
  or separate login-email service. Access configuration and account security still need care.
- **Recovery:** D1 [Time Travel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/time-travel/) is
  always enabled on production databases, with seven days of history on Free and 30 on Paid.
  This bounded recovery window is not an independent backup. Operators should keep appropriate
  private exports and practise the [restore procedure](BACKUP_RESTORE_UPGRADE.md).
- **Optional import assistance:** [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing/)
  and [Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/) offer free allocations
  without a separate AI vendor account or a locally maintained browser/GPU server. They are bounded
  fallbacks, not unlimited services or a guarantee that a shop can be read. Manual entry remains usable.
- **One operating environment:** bindings connect compute, database and optional helpers. Builds
  supports deployment from the installation's repository, with migrations preceding Worker updates.
  Deploying a repository change and obtaining upstream changes are separate responsibilities.

The costs of this choice are platform-specific APIs, dependence on Cloudflare availability and
account policies, and processing of application data by Cloudflare. Free-tier allowances are finite
and can change; see the dated [deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md). The project does not promise
offline operation, a Docker/NAS installation, jurisdiction-specific processing or a free-tier SLA.
SQL exports aid data portability, but moving the complete app elsewhere requires replacing its
Workers, D1 and Access integrations. Operators still manage invitations, updates, usage and backups.

## Cloudflare services

- **Workers:** application compute and server rendering.
- **D1:** relational application data and migrations.
- **Access:** invitation-only authentication using an exact email allow-list, one-time PINs and a
  setup-enforced 30-day application session.
- **Access API:** organiser additions create one exact-email Allow policy using a narrowly scoped
  Worker secret; it does not send invitation email.
- **Workers AI:** product-detail enrichment for incomplete public page metadata.
- **Browser Run:** one-shot rendered HTML fallback after an ordinary product-page fetch cannot
  provide usable content.
- **Workers Logs:** operational logs without assertions, private claims or sensitive query strings.

R2, KV, Queues and application-managed email are intentionally absent. Introduce another service only
for a concrete requirement, with free-tier and setup impact documented. Product import continues to
work without Browser Run or Workers AI; their bindings are included because they materially improve
the existing helper without becoming persistence or availability dependencies.

## Security and caching baseline

- all application documents are `private, no-store`;
- CSP allows only the resources the application currently needs and no third-party scripts/fonts;
- form actions remain same-origin, with a `same-origin` referrer policy so browsers send a verifiable
  `Origin` header for ordinary HTML form posts; opaque, missing and cross-origin mutations are rejected
  before authentication, and mutation bodies are capped at 32 KiB;
- external product links accept only HTTP(S), reject embedded credentials and render safely;
- automatically loaded product images pass through the bounded same-origin raster proxy and never
  cause a family browser to contact the remote image host directly;
- product metadata fetches accept only public HTTP(S) pages, validate each redirect and use the same
  restrained desktop-browser navigation profile for initial requests and retries. They never forward
  user headers, credentials, cookies or referrers, stop after 8 seconds, inspect at most 512 KiB of
  HTML and reject verification pages;
- Browser Run is called at most once and only after an ordinary metadata request fails, receives only
  the validated public product URL, returns bounded HTML, and must pass the same public-navigation and
  challenge checks before extraction;
- AI receives at most 10,000 characters of reduced public-page text, returns only draft fields and
  cannot override deterministic metadata or persist data;
- every metadata/AI entry point shares a D1-backed budget of 12 lookups per member per minute;
- every user-controlled database value uses a prepared statement with `.bind()`;
- only an authenticated admin member can create a family invitation, the Access API request can create
  only the exact-email policy shape constructed by the server, and only an active D1 invitation can
  provision any member after the first organiser;
- mutations validate type, length, UUID, ownership and allowed state at the server boundary;
- errors shown to users do not reveal internals;
- logs omit tokens, private claim surprises and query strings;
- public viewing secrets are hashed at rest, redacted from application logs and can read only one
  claim-free wishlist;
- public sharing Access applications are hostname-specific, idempotently created from the same
  bounded implementation used by setup, and rejected if their destinations or policy drift; and
- format, lint, type, Workers-runtime tests, build and dependency audit gate every push.

## Deployment boundary

Shared `wrangler.jsonc` has a local-only D1 identity and no Cloudflare account ID. Vite merges the
ignored `.wishlist-installation.json` or the build variable `WISHLIST_INSTALLATION` into a generated
configuration. The production script rejects a build for a different installation before running
any remote migration. See [Installation settings](INSTALLATION_CONFIG.md).

The setup sequence verifies the member schema and the actual deployed D1 UUID before first login.
`setup:access-app` uses the wider `cf` API CLI to provision or verify an exact Worker destination and
email-code policies. `setup:access` checks that boundary before applying sessions/sharing and
installing all six runtime settings over Wrangler stdin. The scoped token is not written locally.
Wrangler subprocesses use the installed Node entry on every OS, avoiding Windows command shims.

`main` is connected to Cloudflare Builds for the reference deployment. Application deployments are
automatic after a push; pending D1 migrations run through `deploy:production` before Worker deployment. Initial
Access, DNS and token setup remain separate operations. The setup command and first viewing-link
action use that scoped token to configure only the documented public paths. Later exact-email
additions are deliberately performed by the organiser from `/family`.

The removal/re-invitation update uses existing `disabled_at` and invitation states without a new
backfill. Previously removed members are restored in place, and supported named sharing tokens are
retained. Upgrade regressions populate a database at migration `0011`, apply the remaining migrations
in order and repeat the migration run, checking preserved IDs, wishes, claims, invitations and links.
The group-sharing migration is additive so the previous Worker can continue using its existing
tables during deployment. Production command tests also enforce stopping on migration failure and
retaining applied SQL when the subsequent Worker deployment fails.

Public fork setup is documented in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md). The maintainer checkout may also
contain an ignored `.private/WRANGLER_PROFILE.md` with account-specific context; it must remain private.

### Release update trigger

Manual and automatic GitHub updates use one release-only household workflow. Its updater copies
only the gate-passed upstream `stable` snapshot; Cloudflare Builds applies migrations and deploys
the household commit. Automatic mode uses a Cloudflare Cron Trigger on the existing Worker, not
GitHub’s scheduled-event service. The scheduled handler dispatches the workflow on household `main`
with an automatic input; the workflow also requires its explicit opt-in variable.

The optional encrypted `WISHLIST_UPDATE_CONFIG` secret contains only the household repository and
a fine-grained GitHub Actions read/write key scoped to that repository. Missing settings leave
manual installations inactive. The scheduled handler has no public HTTP endpoint, reads no D1
family data, rejects malformed settings and the reference repository, and sends credentials only
to the fixed GitHub API origin with redirects forbidden and a bounded timeout. Logs distinguish
accepted dispatches from completed deployments and never include keys or upstream response bodies.
The Cloudflare build check remains the deployment-success boundary.
